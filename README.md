## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (e.g., JDK 17 or higher for Spring Boot)
  * **Apache Maven** (for managing Spring Boot project dependencies and builds)
  
  * **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sagarghodke1204/Shopverse-ecommerce.git
    cd Shopverse-ecommerce
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

      * Navigate into the backend project directory (e.g., `cd backend` or the root of the cloned repository if it's a single module).
      * Build the project using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```



3.  **Database Configuration:**

      * *(Provide instructions for database setup. This typically involves creating a database and updating the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file in the Spring Boot backend with your database credentials and connection details.)*

    <!-- end list -->

    ```properties
    # Example application.properties snippet
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/shopverse_db
    spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # or create
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

      * From the root of the backend project (where the `pom.xml` is located):
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
      * The Spring Boot application will typically start on `http://localhost:8080` (or as configured in your `application.properties`).

2.  **Access the Frontend:**

      * Once the backend is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
        ```
        http://localhost:8080
        ```
      * This will serve the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the Shopverse application.
